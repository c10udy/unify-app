// About Section
export const aboutUnify = [
  `Currently, Allergen and Nutrition menus are confined to the
  restaurant's websites and may be difficult to access or read for the
  average user. Frustrated by this, Founder of Unify, Eli
  created Unify as a school project to make important Allergen and
  Nutrition information more accessible. Unify is an all accessible web
  application, able to provide fast access to allergen and nutrition
  information for any given restaurant's menu. By consolidating multiple
  restaurant menus into one platform, users are able to easily find
  information they require to have a safe, and stress free experience
  when eating out.`,
];

// Vision Section
export const vision = [
  `At the moment, it is the restaurant's responsibility to provide allergen
   and nutrition information to their customers. They use a wide range of 
   solutions for this however, the industry standard is a chart that displays 
   the allergens in a menu option. This is both inefficient and ineffective in 
   providing a consumer the information they are looking for and leads to many 
   prospective customers leaving due to the hassle. Another solution restaurants
   use is uploading a PDF or image of the nutrition and allergen information 
   onto their websites. This provides the information the consumer is looking
   for, but is difficult to read and is not a good experience for the consumer. 
   Lastly, many restaurants keep a binder of allergen and nutrition information
   in their brick and mortar restaurant. While this also provides the consumer 
   with the information they need, it is very inaccessible and requires a 
   consumer to be in the restaurant. Unify aims to provide a solution to all of these 
   problems by providing the user with information they need, making this 
   information accessible and easy to understand, and lastly unifying multiple 
   restaurants in one spot on the internet allowing a user to compare and make 
   informed decisions before entering a restaurant.`,
